There will be no make ups for these writing prompts.\n\n\n\nLab assignments are designed to expand your statistical knowledge. These will be completed in JupyterHub which can be accessed from Canvas. There are approximately 2 lab assignments every week that you can complete during class time. The lab assignment will be due either on Tuesday or Thursday at 11:59 PM following the lab day it was assigned.\n\n\n\nReading assignments are designed to teach you different statistical concepts and R Programming. As the course progresses, many of the concepts build on each other. Therefore, the assignments encourage you to read each chapter in an appropriate amount of time. You must read the chapter and answer the questions by the Sunday night at 11:59 PM. The 2 lowest reading assignments will be dropped.\n\n\n\nStarting on Week 2, there will be a weekly quiz every Friday. The quiz will become available for you to take on Canvas at 12AM to 11:59 PM every Friday. The quiz is designed to test whether you recall the material from the previous week. You are expected to complete the quiz with out using any material such as your notes, textbook, or internet. Additionally, you will get 90% of the quiz grade for simply taking the quiz. The remaining 20% is based on getting the question correct. There are a total of 12 quizzes in the semester. The lowest 3 quizzes will be dropped from your class grade. There are no make up quizzes.\n\n\n\nThere will be three in exams. Exam #1 will on Sept 25, Exam #2 will be on Nov 8, and Exam #3 will be on Dec 6 at 8-10 AM (Sec 01) or 1-3 PM (Sec 02). While the exams are not considered cumulative, the material builds on each other. Developing a strong understanding of the material through out the course is important for your success. At the end of the semester, your lowest exam grade will be replaced by your median average exam grade. This course will operate under a zero-tolerance policy. Talking during the time of the exam, sharing materials, looking at another students’ exam, or not following directions given will be subject to the University’s academic integrity policy.\n\n\n\nThere will be 3 extra credit opportunities worth a total of 10% of your overall grade.

Do not submit others’ work as your own. For assignments and quizzes that allow you to work with a group, only put your name on what the group submits if you genuinely contributed to the work. Work completely independently on exams, using only the materials that are indicated as allowed. Failure to observe academic honesty results in substantial penalties that can include failing the course.\nDisabilities:\nIf you are a student with a disability requesting reasonable accommodations in this course, you need to contact Disability Accommodations and Support Services (DASS) located on the second floor of Arroyo Hall, via email accommodations@csuci.edu or call 805-437-3331. All requests for reasonable accommodations require registration with DASS in advance of need: https://www.csuci.edu/dass/students/apply-for-services.htm. Faculty, students and DASS will work together regarding classroom accommodations. You are encouraged to discuss approved.\nEmergency Procedure Notice to Students:\nCSUCI is following guidelines and public orders from the California Department of Public Health and Ventura County Public Health for the COVID-19 pandemic as it pertains to CSUCI students, employees and visitors on the campus. Students are expected to adhere to all health and safety requirements as noted on the University’s Spring 2023 Semester website or they may be subject to removal from the classroom.\n\n\n\n\nThe California Faculty Association (the labor union of Lecturers, Professors, Coaches, Counselors, and Librarians across the 23 CSU campuses) is in a difficult contract dispute with California State University management. It is possible that we will call a strike or other work stoppage this term. I promise to promptly inform you of any schedule disruption. Our working conditions are your learning conditions; we seek to protect both. For further information go to www.CFAbargaining.org."

Do not submit others’ work as your own. For assignments and quizzes that allow you to work with a group, only put your name on what the group submits if you genuinely contributed to the work. Work completely independently on exams, using only the materials that are indicated as allowed. Failure to observe academic honesty results in substantial penalties that can include failing the course.\nDisabilities:\nIf you are a student with a disability requesting reasonable accommodations in this course, you need to contact Disability Accommodations and Support Services (DASS) located on the second floor of Arroyo Hall, via email accommodations@csuci.edu or call 805-437-3331. All requests for reasonable accommodations require registration with DASS in advance of need: https://www.csuci.edu/dass/students/apply-for-services.htm. Faculty, students and DASS will work together regarding classroom accommodations. You are encouraged to discuss approved.\nEmergency Procedure Notice to Students:\nCSUCI is following guidelines and public orders from the California Department of Public Health and Ventura County Public Health for the COVID-19 pandemic as it pertains to CSUCI students, employees and visitors on the campus. Students are expected to adhere to all health and safety requirements as noted on the University’s Spring 2023 Semester website or they may be subject to removal from the classroom.\n\n\n\n\nThe California Faculty Association (the labor union of Lecturers, Professors, Coaches, Counselors, and Librarians across the 23 CSU campuses) is in a difficult contract dispute with California State University management. It is possible that we will call a strike or other work stoppage this term. I promise to promptly inform you of any schedule disruption. Our working conditions are your learning conditions; we seek to protect both. For further information go to www.CFAbargaining.org."
