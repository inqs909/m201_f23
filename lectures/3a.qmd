# Data Distribution

## Data Distribution

When thinking about data, we know an attribute is allowed to vary. With this variation, some numbers are more likely to be observed than others.

## Data

When inspecting data:

-   Do not focus on one individual data point.

-   See how data points interact with each other

-   See what is common

-   See what is rare

# Visualizing Distributions

## Data

```{r}
set.seed(6)
working_1 <- rnorm(8, 10, 2) |> round(1)
working_1
```

## Visualizing Data

Why should we visualize data?

## Introduction to Histograms

```{r}
working_1
```

## Visualizing Data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
working_1
working_1 |> hist(xlab = "", main = "")
```

## Histograms

-   X-Axis: the values from the sample

    -   These are binned to capture a range of numbers

-   Y-Axis: the frequency of the data

-   Displays which values are the most common

## Shape

Shape is how we describe the histogram:

-   Left Skewed

-   Right Skewed

-   Unimodal

-   Bimodal

-   Narrow

-   Wide

## Left Skewed

```{r}
(rchisq(100, 3) * -1) |> hist(xlab = "", main = "")
```

## Right Skewed

```{r}
rchisq(100, 3) |> hist(xlab = "", main = "")
```

## Unimodal

```{r}
rnorm(1000) |> hist(xlab = "", main = "")

```

## Narrow

```{r}
rnorm(10000) |> hist(main = "", xlab = "") 
```

## Wide

```{r}
rnorm(1000, sd = 1000) |> hist(main = "", xlab = "") 
```

## Bimodal

```{r}
c(rnorm(1000, 10), rnorm(1000,15)) |> hist(xlab = "", main = "")
```

## Center

```{r}
rnorm(1000) |> hist(main = "", xlab = "")
```

## Spread

## Weird
